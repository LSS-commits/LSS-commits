I'm not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roujin_Z" target="_blank">cool old guy behind a computer</a>, but I do plan to code with the same hunger and candid curiosity until my motherboard fails me.

What you'll find here is mostly PHP, JavaScript and Typescript, for now.


<strong>Peace be upon you</strong>
